        <p> Currently I am a student at the University of Waterloo in Mechatronics Engineering. I have a strong passion for engineering; particularly robotics, energy, automation, aerospace, and most related industries. Personally, I am most interested in <span class="text-secondary">embedded systems, firmware, hardware, electronics, modelling and data engineering</span>. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking mountains, sports like mixed martial arts, basketball, and volleyball; along with simple sketch drawing, non-fiction books, and new experiences.</p>
